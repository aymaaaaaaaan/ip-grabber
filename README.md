# ip-grabber

READ THE WHOLE THING SO THEN THE GRABBER WORKS

First, edit the python file so then in line 8, instead of it saying "your webhook url here", it has your discord webhook url in there.
Find a youtube toturial on how to get your webhook url if you do not know how.

Next, make sure to convert the python file into an exe with these steps:

1) Install python
2) Go to the command prompt and then write "pip install pyinstaller"
3) then find the folder that the python file is in and write "cd" and a space, then your file location
4) then write pyinstaller -onefile ipgrabber.py (or whatever your filename is)
5) then go into the folder that the command creates after it finishes and get the executable that had the same name as the python file.
